# udacity-Movie_Trailer_Website
Project 1

Renders a webpage using the Media class and movie information entered in the Entertainment_center module.

I used the foundation provided in the "Programming Foundations with Python" course, but removed the need to add more than the title of the movie and the youtube url when initializing the Media class instance.
This code also utilizes the Open Movie Database api available at omdbapi.com, as well as Bootstrap, available at getbootstrap.com.

#How to use
Create an instance of the Movie object with the title as the first argument and the youtube url as the second.  Make sure you add the name of your Movie object to the "unsorted_movies" array.  When you run entertainment_center.py, it will build the page and open it in your default browser.
