Project 1

Renders a webpage using the Media class and movie information entered in the Entertainment_center module.

#How to use
Create an instance of the Movie object with the title as the first argument and the youtube url as the second.  Make sure you add the name of your object to the "unsorted_movies" array.  When you run entertainment_center.py, it will build the page and open it in your default browser.
